Math-To-Manim Smolagent Prototype

This file demonstrates the planned integration with the Hugging Face smolagents framework.
It provides a prototype implementation of the agent that will transform simple prompts
into detailed, LaTeX-rich prompts for generating Manim code.

Note: This is a prototype and requires the smolagents package to be installed.
