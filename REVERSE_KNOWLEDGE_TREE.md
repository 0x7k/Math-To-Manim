# Reverse Knowledge Tree Architecture
## Recursive Concept Decomposition for Math-To-Manim

**Powered by**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Claude Agent SDK

**Core Insight**: Don't train on examples. Instead, build a knowledge tree by asking "What do I need to understand BEFORE this?" recursively until reaching foundational concepts, then animate from foundation → target.

**Technology**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5's superior reasoning capabilities via the Claude Agent SDK - no training data required!

---

## The Problem with Training Data Approach

**Wrong**: "Learn patterns from simple → verbose prompt pairs"
- Requires massive training datasets
- Limited to what we've seen before
- Doesn't generalize to new topics
- Brittle when concepts evolve

**Right**: "Recursively decompose any concept into prerequisites"
- Works on ANY mathematical/scientific topic
- Discovers connections dynamically
- Self-enriching through exploration
- Builds complete conceptual understanding

---

## The Reverse Knowledge Tree Algorithm

### Step 1: Question Analysis
```
User: "Explain cosmology to me"

Concept Agent asks:
1. What is the core concept? → "cosmology"
2. What domain? → "physics/astronomy"
3. What level? → "beginner" (inferred from casual language)
```

### Step 2: Prerequisite Discovery (Recursive)
```
Question: "To understand cosmology, what must I know first?"

Answer (from Research Agent):
- General Relativity (high-level)
- Hubble's Law
- Redshift
- Cosmic Microwave Background
- Dark Matter & Dark Energy

For EACH prerequisite, ask again:
"To understand General Relativity, what must I know first?"
  → Special Relativity
  → Differential Geometry (simplified)
  → Gravitational Fields

"To understand Special Relativity, what must I know first?"
  → Galilean Relativity
  → Speed of light constancy
  → Lorentz Transformations

... continue until hitting FOUNDATION concepts that need no prerequisites
```

### Step 3: Foundation Identification
```
Stopping criteria:
- Concept is "common knowledge" (high school level)
- No further meaningful decomposition
- Recursion depth limit reached (configurable: 3-5 levels)

Foundation for cosmology example:
Level 0 (Foundation):
  - Basic geometry (distances, angles)
  - Velocity concept
  - Light as waves
  - Time measurement

Level 1 (Building blocks):
  - Galilean relativity
  - Doppler effect
  - Gravity basics

Level 2 (Intermediate):
  - Special relativity
  - Curved spacetime intuition
  - Redshift

Level 3 (Advanced):
  - General relativity concepts
  - Universe expansion
  - CMB

Level 4 (Target):
  - Cosmology (Big Bang, inflation, dark energy)
```

### Step 4: Knowledge Tree Construction
```
cosmology
├── general_relativity
│   ├── special_relativity
│   │   ├── galilean_relativity [FOUNDATION]
│   │   ├── speed_of_light [FOUNDATION]
│   │   └── lorentz_transforms
│   ├── curved_spacetime
│   │   ├── gravity [FOUNDATION]
│   │   └── geometry [FOUNDATION]
│   └── field_equations
├── hubbles_law
│   ├── redshift
│   │   ├── doppler_effect [FOUNDATION]
│   │   └── wavelength [FOUNDATION]
│   └── expansion
├── cmb
│   ├── blackbody_radiation [FOUNDATION]
│   └── early_universe
└── dark_matter
    └── galaxy_rotation [FOUNDATION]
```

### Step 5: Enrichment Walk (Foundation → Target)
```
Now traverse the tree FROM the leaves UP:

1. Start at foundation concepts
   For each concept at current level:
   - Generate mathematical formulas
   - Create visual metaphors
   - Write narrative explanation
   - Design animation sequence

2. Move up one level
   Build on what was explained below:
   - Connect to prerequisites
   - Add complexity incrementally
   - Maintain visual continuity

3. Repeat until reaching target concept

Result: Complete narrative arc from basics → cosmology
```

## Example Walkthrough

### Input
```
"Explain cosmology to me"
```

### Agent Pipeline Execution

#### 1. Concept Analyzer
```json
{
  "core_concept": "cosmology",
  "domain": "physics/astronomy",
  "level": "beginner",
  "visual_potential": "excellent",
  "goal": "Big Bang → present day universe"
}
```

#### 2. Prerequisite Explorer (Recursive)
```
Depth 0: "To understand cosmology, what must I know?"
  → General Relativity, Hubble's Law, Redshift, CMB

Depth 1: "To understand General Relativity, what must I know?"
  → Special Relativity, Curved Spacetime, Gravity

Depth 2: "To understand Special Relativity, what must I know?"
  → Galilean Relativity, Speed of Light, Reference Frames

Depth 3: Foundation reached
  → All concepts here are understandable to high school graduate
  → STOP recursion
```

**Resulting Tree**:
```
cosmology [target]
├─ general_relativity
│  ├─ special_relativity
│  │  ├─ galilean_relativity [FOUND]
│  │  ├─ speed_of_light [FOUND]
│  │  └─ reference_frames [FOUND]
│  └─ curved_spacetime
│     ├─ geometry [FOUND]
│     └─ gravity [FOUND]
├─ hubbles_law
│  ├─ redshift
│  │  └─ doppler_effect [FOUND]
│  └─ distance_measurement [FOUND]
└─ cmb
   └─ blackbody_radiation [FOUND]
```

#### 3. Mathematical Enricher
Walks tree, adds equations to each node:

```python
{
  'galilean_relativity': {
    'equation': r"v' = v - u",
    'meaning': "velocity in moving frame",
    'example': "Ball on a train"
  },
  'doppler_effect': {
    'equation': r"f' = f \frac{v}{v \pm v_s}",
    'meaning': "frequency shift from motion",
    'example': "Ambulance siren"
  },
  # ... for every node
}
```

#### 4. Visual Designer
For each concept, specifies how to animate:

```python
{
  'galilean_relativity': {
    'elements': ['train', 'ball', 'reference_frames'],
    'colors': {'train': BLUE, 'ball': RED},
    'animation': 'Show ball thrown on moving train, compare ground/train perspectives',
    'duration': 15
  },
  'redshift': {
    'elements': ['wave', 'stretching_space', 'color_gradient'],
    'colors': 'gradient from BLUE → RED',
    'animation': 'Wave stretches as space expands, color shifts',
    'duration': 20
  },
  # ... every node gets visual spec
}
```

#### 5. Narrative Composer
Stitches into verbose prompt (2000+ tokens):

```
# Manim Animation: Cosmology

## Scene 1: Galilean Relativity (0:00-0:15)

Begin with a train moving at constant velocity across the screen from left to right,
rendered as a simple blue rectangle with wheels. Show a figure inside the train
throwing a red ball upward. Split the screen into two reference frames...

[continues for 200 words with detailed Manim instructions, LaTeX formatting, colors]

## Scene 2: Speed of Light Constancy (0:15-0:30)

Building on the previous reference frames, now introduce a beam of light from the
train's headlight. Write the equation $c = 299,792,458 \text{ m/s}$ in the corner...

[200 more words]

## Scene 3: Special Relativity (0:30-1:00)

Now that we understand reference frames and light's constant speed, introduce the
Lorentz transformation. Show two synchronized clocks, one on the train moving at
0.9c, one on the ground. Display the time dilation formula...

[200 more words]

... [continues through ALL concepts in tree]

## Scene 12: Cosmology - The Big Bang (4:30-5:00)

Now bringing together everything we've learned - relativity, expansion, redshift -
we arrive at cosmology. Begin with a single point of infinite density. Show the
Friedmann equation: $$\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho$$

Animate the scale factor $a(t)$ growing from 0 to present day...

[200 more words of detailed instructions]
```

**Total**: ~2400 tokens of rich, detailed prompt

#### 6. Code Generator
Feed verbose prompt to DeepSeek R1 → produces working Manim code (your existing strength!)

## Key Differences from Original Plan

| Original (Training-Based) | New (Recursive Decomposition) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Learn from examples | Reason from first principles |
| Requires datasets | Zero training data |
| Limited to seen patterns | Works on any topic |
| Static knowledge | Dynamic exploration |
| Pattern matching | Logical decomposition |
| Prompt Agent is ML model | Prompt Agent is tree walker |

   - Start with simple topics
   - Test recursion depth limits
   - Validate foundation detection

2. **Test on diverse topics**
   - Math: Calculus, topology, number theory
   - Physics: QM, relativity, thermodynamics
   - CS: Algorithms, complexity theory
   - Cross-domain: Game theory, information theory

3. **Build tree visualization**
   - Show users the knowledge tree
   - Let them prune/expand branches
   - Interactive exploration

4. **Optimize**
